## üí° Pro Tips

### For Efficient Reading

1. **Start broad, go deep:** Read overviews first (00, 01, 02), then dive into implementation (03-06)
2. **Follow cross-references:** Docs link to each other with "See also" sections
3. **Use glossary proactively:** Don't skip unfamiliar terms, look them up immediately
4. **Refer to diagrams:** Visual learners should focus on mermaid diagrams in 02-ARCHITECTURE.md

### For Efficient Implementation

1. **Follow the 4-week plan:** Don't jump ahead, foundation first
2. **Test incrementally:** Validate each flow before moving to next
3. **Use the runbook:** When something breaks, check 02-ARCHITECTURE.md ‚Üí Runbook
4. **Track metrics early:** Set up PostHog in Week 1, not Week 4

### For Team Collaboration

1. **Assign docs by role:** Product reads 00-01, Backend reads 03-06, Frontend reads 02+UI sections
2. **Use glossary for shared vocabulary:** Link to 99-GLOSSARY.md in discussions
3. **Reference doc sections in tickets:** "Implement Flow 3 (see 04-DATA-PIPELINE.md, line 234)"
4. **Update docs as you code:** If implementation diverges, update docs immediately
